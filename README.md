# Graffit: Social Media Platform Development(C/C++)


After a prolonged period of social distancing, it's become increasingly vital for us to connect with one another through online media platforms. Social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram provide various ways for users to engage with like-minded individuals. For this assignment, we will create a mock social media platform.

CSCA48â€™s social media network is named GRAFFIT. In GRAFFIT, users (like you and me) can keep track of their friends and the brands they follow (like UTSC). Additionally, we aim to identify which brands are similar to one another. To facilitate this social media service, we will be working with a graph network.
